        <h2>Chapter 1: About Me</h2>

        <p class="intro">
            I grew up on a ranch in a rural town in Oregon. My Childhood was mostly spent taking care of the ranch.
			A couple of my duties were to feed the cows, take care of the landscaping, and walking the fences
			which surrounded the property to make sure there were no holes.
            <span class="sentence">These early experiences gave me an appreciation for nature and a strong work ethic.</span>
        </p>

        <p>
            My family has always been an important part of my life.  
            We used to enjoy gathering for meals, holidays, and special events, but it has been harder since they moved.  
            Their support has helped me stay focused and motivated throughout school and life.
        </p>

        <p>
            One of my favorite hobbies is reading.  
            I tend to read web novels that have been translated from eihter South Korean
			and sometimes even Chinese. This is just because I have found myself really 
			enjoying the way those stories are written and how they tend to be
			different than our own. 
        </p>

        <p>
            In addition to reading, I also enjoy spending either taking walks, hiking, or playing video games. 
			An awesome spot that I used to go to would be Crater Lake which a lot of travel places consider
			"one of the seven wonders of Oregon." A couple of cool hikes are the Table Rocks which are located
			in Southern Oregon where I grew up. They are called the Table Rocks because the top of them are 
			nearly flat so when looking at them from afar they look like giant tables.
