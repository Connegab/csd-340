    <h1>Assignment 9.3: JavaScript - Part 1</h1>

    <p>
      I grew up on a <span id="ranch">_________</span> in a rural town in Oregon. My childhood was filled with
      responsibilities and work that helped shape my character and discipline.
    </p>

    <p>
      My <span id="family">_________</span> has always been an important part of my life. Their support has kept me
      motivated through school and work, and I will always be grateful for their encouragement.
    </p>

    <p>
      In my free time, I love reading web <span id="novels">_________</span> that are translated from South Korean or
      Chinese. The unique storytelling styles captivate me and offer fresh perspectives.
    </p>

    <p>
      One of my favorite places is Crater Lake, located in southern <span id="oregon">_________</span>. Hiking around
      there always reminds me of the beauty of my home state.
